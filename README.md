# hannahs_profile
This is a work profile for my wife Hannah F.
It shows her work projects and a contact form. 
When on the projects tab you can tab through different projects.
When on the contact form you can submit your info to have hannah contact you.


I have a three Media quearies:
    1. for small devices the header will all center and display in a column reverse.
    2. for larger screens the header will move to a row reverse aligning the picture with contact info.
    3. for much larger screens the tabbing navigation will move from vertical to columns to a row.

My one CSS feature is a flex box layout. where text wraps and can be manipulated with screen manipulation.

My one JavaScript feature are two tabbing features that allow the user to hide information by clicking buttons, both at the top tabbing between portfolio and contact form, then again within the portfolio to tab through the projects Hannah has worked on.

My one additional feature is an email validator. It shows an alert when an email in entered incorrectly.
